                <img src="img2.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="my image">
                My name is Dickson Muli. I was born and raised in Kenya,<br>
                D.C. but moved here to Cardiff thirty years ago with my family. I have dedicated my life to helping <br>
                others. For 35 years I was a professional nurse at the county hospital. I began my career as a <br>
                nurse in the Second World War, and also assisted soldiers injured in Korea, Vietnam, and here at home.<br>
                For the last decade, I have been a school nurse, and now I live with my son, his wife and their two children.<br>
                It has been a beautiful life.
                I settled on nursing because taking care of the soldiers seemed so natural to me. I met my husband on the <br>
                battlefield.My children were born the year we ended the war and declared peace.  What else could I have done? <br>
                This life of service found me.
One of the most interesting things has been meeting people in all the countries I’ve visited. In times  <br>
of distress, you really see how tight each community becomes. If someone is in the water, they’re plucked out. <br>
If someone is injured, they’re bandaged. There are no questions, just action. I’d love to see that kind of <br>
community support all over the world. Not just during times of war and disaster, but in everyday life.  <br>
The villages that support each other are the villages that succeed. In this giant village of Britain,  <br>
it’s vital that we remember that our responsibilities lie not just with ourselves, but also with our neighbors. <br>
Our liberation is bound to the liberation of others.
I’d like to think I’ve done my part, been as useful as possible, and given to the best of my abilities.  <br>
For now, I’d like to continue mentoring young nurses and enjoying my time with family and friends.

             After the first portrait I drew in my high school art class, I became captivated with <br>
             the challenge of photorealistic drawing and the meticulous attention to detail that it required.<br>
             The labor-intensive commitment to photorealism caused me to feel driven to continue improving <br>
             my technique. In college I spent a majority of my free time drawing portraits with colored pencil.<br>
             Being in the age of growing social media platforms, I decided to share my lengthy process online<br>
             through time-lapse videos. I began drawing and filming portraits of people that a broad audience<br>
             would be familiar with, including celebrities, athletes, and public figures. To my surprise,<br>
             my work began to attract a large audience, with videos surpassing 1 million views. <br>
             Along with my studies as an art student, I continued doing this throughout my college career.<br>
             This generated a large global audience for my work, with over 1 million subscribers.<br>
